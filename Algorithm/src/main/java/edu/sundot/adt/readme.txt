Tree:
    Leaf: External node.
    Height: Max distance from leaf to root.
    Depth: Distance from node to root.

    Binary Tree:
        Can have maximum 2 children only.

    Binary Search Tree:
        All the nodes on the left contains less or equal value compared to all the children on the right of any node.

    Balanced Tree(for any tree)
        Depth of subtrees will not vary by more than 1.

Graph: (Mark node as visited to prevent cycle.)
    DFS: Exhaustive Search
        In-order
        Pre-order
        Post-order
    BFS: Remember the implementation with queue. Queue makes the implementation very easy and straight.
